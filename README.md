## Setting up a new project

If you would like to fork this repo and start your own spreadsheet setup. You will need to set two specific environment variables. They are `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `SPREADSHEET_ID`.

### Client ID

The Client ID can be found in the google developer console.

1. Setup and google cloud account, ideally tied to your gmail or some other google workspace account.
2. Navigate to `/apis/credentials` and click `+ Create Credentials`, then `Oauth Client ID`
3. For application type, choose `Web Application`
4. Set your Authorized Javascript Origins, for local development this may be `http://localhost:8888`, the url for your deployed code will need to be set too (eg. something like `https://fresh-approach.netlify.app`).
5. Set your Authorized Redirects, for local development this may be `http://localhost:8888/redirect`.

### Spreadsheet ID

The spreadsheet ID can be found in the url for the spreadsheet that you are accessing for your data.
It is:

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=<SOME_OTHER_ID>
```

A template for the spreadsheet is available (here).[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bboLpsDu0I8MkYON5ri39arQlW8HkN-kqbnL7oRq3C4/edit#gid=0].

To create your own food distribution map with your own data, go to File, select `Make a Copy` of the spreadsheet, and start filling in your own locations, distributions and purchases.
